# SAT-300-dataset
Dataset of 300 short ambiguous texts used to evaluate named entity recognition and disambiguation performance.

The SAT-300 dataset aims to provide ground truth for the task of Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation.
Its main focus is on short texts that have a high density of ambiguous named entities.
Each one of the dataset's 300 texts is accompanied with its named entities' start and end character offsets, as well as their best matches in Wikipedia and Google Knowledge Graph. Both the entities' limits in text and their corresponding canonical entities were extracted and verified by humans.
